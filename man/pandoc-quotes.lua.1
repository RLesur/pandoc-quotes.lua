pandoc-quotes.lua - Replaces plain quotation marks with typographic ones
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] \f[B]--lua-filter\f[R] \f[I]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-quotes\f[R] is a filter for \f[B]pandoc\f[R] that replaces
plain, that is, non-typographic, quotes with typographic ones for
languages other than English.
(It\[aq]s not that it doesn\[aq]t work with English, too; it\[aq]s just
that you don\[aq]t need it.)
.PP
You can define which typographic quotation marks to replace plain ones
with by setting either a document\[aq]s \f[I]quotation-marks\f[R],
\f[I]quotation-language\f[R], or \f[I]lang\f[R] metadata field.
.SS quotation-marks
.PP
A list of four strings, where the first item lists the primary left
quotation mark, the second the primary right quotation mark, the third
the secondary left quotation mark, and the fourth the secondary right
quotation mark.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quotation-marks:
    - \[aq]\[aq]
    - \[aq]\[aq]
    - \[aq]
    - \[aq]
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You always have to set all four.
.PP
If each quotation mark consists of one character only, you can write the
whole list as a simple string.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quotation-marks: \[dq]\[dq]\[aq]\[aq]
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If \f[I]quotation-marks\f[R] is set, the other fields are ignored.
.SH quotation-lang
.PP
An RFC 5646-like code for the language the quotation marks of which
shall be used (e.g., \[dq]en-US\[dq], \[dq]pt-BR\[dq], \[dq]de\[dq],
\[dq]es\[dq]).
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
quotation-lang: de-AT
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Only the language and the country tags of RFC 5646 are
supported.
For example, \[dq]it-CH\[dq] (i.e., Italian as spoken in Switzerland) is
fine, but \[dq]it-756\[dq] (also Italian as spoken in Switzerland) will
return the quotation marks for \[dq]it\[dq] (i.e., Italian as spoken in
general).
.PP
If \f[I]quotation-marks\f[R] is set, \f[I]quotation-lang\f[R] is
ignored.
.SH lang
.PP
The format of \f[I]lang\f[R] is the same as for
\f[I]quotation-lang\f[R].
If \f[I]quotation-marks\f[R] or \f[I]quotation-lang\f[R] is set,
\f[I]lang\f[R] is ignored.
.PP
\f[I]lang\f[R] is the metadata field \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] uses to
define what language your reference list should be in.
If \f[B]pandoc-citeproc\f[R] and \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] both
support your language, you need not set \f[I]quotation-lang\f[R],
\f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] will use \f[I]lang\f[R], too.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
---
lang: de-AT
\&...
\f[R]
.fi
.SH ADDING LANGUAGES
.PP
You can add quotation marks for unsupported languages, or override the
defaults, by placing a file named \f[I]quot-marks.yaml\f[R] in your
pandoc user data directory.
.PP
\f[I]quot-marks.yaml\f[R] should be a, UTF-8 encoded, YAML file.
It should contain mappings of RFC 5646-like language codes (e.g.,
\[dq]en-US\[dq], \[dq]pt-BR\[dq], \[dq]de\[dq], \[dq]es\[dq]) to lists
of quotation marks, which are given in the same format as for
\f[I]quotation-marks\f[R].
.PP
See the \f[I]quot-marks.yaml\f[R] file that comes with
\f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] for details.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
\f[B]pandoc\f[R] represents documents as abstract syntax trees, and
quotations are nodes in that tree.
However, \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] replaces those nodes with the
content of the quotation, adding proper quotation marks.
Put another way, \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] pushes quotations from the
syntax of a document\[aq]s representation into its semantics.
As a consequence, filters running after \f[B]pandoc-quotes\f[R]
won\[aq]t recognise quotes.
That being so, you should \f[I]not\f[R] use \f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R]
with output formats that represent quotes syntactically (e.g., HTML,
LaTeX, ConTexT).
Also, it should be the last or one of the last filters you apply.
.PP
Support for quotation marks of different languages is incomplete and
likely erroneous.
See <https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes.lua> if you\[aq]d like to
help with this.
.PP
\f[B]pandoc-quotes.lua\f[R] is Unicode-agnostic.
